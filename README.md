# Python-Voice-Assistant
This is a virtual voice assistant application that I created using various libraries and modules from the python 3 progamming language. This appplication can perform a variety of tasks consisting of Wikipedia searches of various topics, opening computer programs and applications at the user's request via voice commands, uploading files and folders to the user's Google Drive and viewing one's Google calendar schedule for a certain day. This program can also help the user make a note of certain things that they would want to remember as well. This application requires one's Google Developer credentials in order to function correctly. Othwerise program will break.
